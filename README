Leaving Word Processors Behind
------------------------------

What is it?
 - some stuff I've collected to help writers migrate away from using word
   processors and toward using text editors, such as FocusWriter

What does it do?
 - It will walk over a directory heirarchy and dump every .odt file therein
   to .txt in MarkDown syntax.
 - Eventually it should also do RTF and other document formats supported by
   OpenOffice.  Even more eventually, it should do formats supported by
   AbiWord or other scriptable open source word processors too.
 - Eventually it should have Nautilus menu items to let you right-click on a
   file and dump it.

Why do I want it?
 - I don't know.  Maybe you don't.  But I did, so I cobbled together the
   pieces and I didn't want to lose my work so I put it in this repository.
   Here you go.

Can I use it?
 - You'll need to have the Python libraries elementtree and markdown, a
   bourne-compatible shell, and make.  If you know what that means, or
   know someone who does, then you can probably use it.

Well, how do I use it?
 - Get software.  Try checking out the git repository.
 - make all # will test that you have the python dependencies and install
   to ~/bin
 - Now you've got it installed you can use it.  For example, to convert every
   OpenOffice document under your home directory in one go, try:
   cd ~
   find . -iname '*.odt' -exec oodump.sh {} \;
 - Alternatively, you can run on a bunch of files, like this:
   oodump.sh ~/Documents/*.odt

It doesn't work!
 - Please check if the issue has been reported before <https://github.com/l0b0/lwpb/issues>, and if so, whether you can add more information to speed up the fix. Be warned that it could take a while, since this is one of many hobby projects.
 - If you're a programmer you're welcome to either submit a patch or fork the project to fix it.

Who do I have to thank?
 - Aaron Swartz, John Gruber, and Yuri Takhteyev created the Open Document Format to text converter, and released it under a GPLv2 license.
 - Joe Blaylock created a wrapper script to convert a whole directory tree in a single operation.
 - Victor Engmark hasn't done anything useful yet, but hopes to add some automated testing, command-line options, and perhaps a Nautilus plugin.
